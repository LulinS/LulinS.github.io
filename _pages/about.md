I am a Ph.D. candidate in Accounting at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. I am expected to join the University of Alberta as an Assistant Professor of Accounting in July 2016.

My research examines the interaction between regulation, disclosure, and ESG-related issues, with a particular focus on social outcomes, including healthcare quality, fair lending, and environmental justice.

Before beginning my doctoral studies, I earned an M.Sc. in Accounting from Peking University and a Bachelor of Management in Accounting from the Central University of Finance and Economics.
